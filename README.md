### Usage
The main function is ``` stabilize_tabs(source_path1, source_path2, folder_titles, output_path) ```. 
* **source_path1** is the path to the file on which the structure of the output file is based on.
* **source_path2** is the path to the "compared" file
* **folder_titles** are the titles of the titles of the link groups to be looked at
* **output_path** is the path to the output file

For now the output file will always be "stabilised_tabs.html".

This was not stress tested, so I will problably be really easy to break it. If any major issues arise you can either propose changes or ask me to fix the bug.
