### Usage
The main function is ``` stabilize_tabs(source_path1, source_path2, folder_title, output_path) ```. 
* **source_path1** is the path to the file on which the structure of the output file is based on.
* **source_path2** is the path to the "compared" file
* **output_path** is the path to the output file

For now the output file will always be "stabilised_tabs.html".
